Gacela is super extensible, that means, it is ready to be used within another framework like Laravel or Symfony.

If you want to do that, you need to bootstrap Gacela at the same time you are bootstrapping the framework, usually, in
the `public/index.php` file and `bin/console` for Symfony or `/bootstrap/app.php` in Laravel.

### Example projects

- Symfony: [https://github.com/gacela-project/symfony-gacela-example](https://github.com/gacela-project/symfony-gacela-example)
- Laravel: [https://github.com/gacela-project/laravel-gacela-example](https://github.com/gacela-project/laravel-gacela-example)
