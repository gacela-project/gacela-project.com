Gacela is very extensible. This means, you can use it within another framework like Laravel or Symfony, for example.

If you want to do that, you need to bootstrap Gacela at the same time you are initializing the framework, usually, in the entry point of your application.

>  For example in Symfony `public/index.php` and `bin/console`. 
> 
> Or, in the case of Laravel, `/bootstrap/app.php`.
